This blog will go over the way I created my Chess Engine "En Passant Chess Engine"
Each numbered sections acts almost as a new "era" with my engine. 
I will discuss what issues I faced, how I overcame them, and any issues I am currently facing
I will also go over implementation changes since the last section
